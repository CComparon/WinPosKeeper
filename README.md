# WinPosKeeper

## What is this?
WinPosKeeper is a small utility for people undocking/redocking their Windows 10 laptop to go to a meeting, and tired of having to reposition and resize their windows manually every single time.

## Build requirements
The easiest is to install Qt and QtCreator using the Qt online installer. The only prerequisites are:   
* A C++11 compiler shipping all standard Win32 header files.
* Qt >= 5.10

## Build instructions
* Use qmake to generate compiler- or IDE-specific project files.
* Use you compiler or IDE to build.
